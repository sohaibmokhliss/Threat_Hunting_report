The client contacted the security team after noticing unexpected activity on a key server. Since
the server hosts sensitive data, the client was concerned about the possibility of unauthorized
access and asked for an investigation to confirm whether the system had been compromised.

🔹 Hypothesis 1 – Legitimate Administrative Activity
The observed activity may have been caused by a legitimate system administrator performing
maintenance or troubleshooting tasks outside of regular hours.
What we check


Known admin accounts



Normal logon patterns



Expected PowerShell usage

How we validate / dismiss


Logons occurred from unfamiliar sources



PowerShell commands were encoded



Activity did not match documented admin behavior

🔹 Hypothesis 2 – Misconfiguration or Automated System Activity
The activity may have been generated by an automated system process, scheduled task, or
misconfiguration.
What we check


Scheduled tasks



Service accounts



Non-interactive logons

How we validate / dismiss


PowerShell execution was interactive



Commands indicated manual reconnaissance



No matching scheduled tasks were identified

🔹 Hypothesis 3 – External Unauthorized Access Using Valid Credentials
An external actor may have attempted to gain access to the server using credential-based
techniques (such as brute-force attempts or Kerberos authentication weaknesses).
What we check


Unusual authentication activity



Interactive logons



PowerShell reconnaissance

Supporting evidence


Unusual authentication behavior



Successful authentication followed by PowerShell execution



Reconnaissance commands consistent with attacker behavior

🔹 Hypothesis 4 – Malware or Automated Exploit
The server may have been compromised by malware or an automated exploit without direct
human interaction.
What we check


Unknown binaries



Exploit indicators



Non-native tools

How we validate / dismiss


No malicious binaries observed



Activity relied on built-in tools



Actions suggest hands-on-keyboard behavior

PHASE 1
Following the client’s request, an investigation was initiated to assess whether unauthorized
activity had occurred on a critical server. The scope of the investigation was limited to the
Domain Controller and focused on authentication and execution activity during the timeframe in
which the unexpected behavior was reported.
Phase 2
To understand the sequence of events, a timeline-based analysis was conducted using
authentication and execution logs collected from the Domain Controller. Relevant events were
correlated chronologically to identify patterns of activity and determine whether the observed
behavior aligned with legitimate use or potential unauthorized access.
Phase 3
With the timeline established, each hypothesis was evaluated against the observed events to
determine which scenario was most consistent with the activity on the Domain Controller.

🔹 Hypothesis 1 – Legitimate Administrative Activity
The observed activity may have been caused by a legitimate system administrator performing
maintenance or troubleshooting tasks outside of regular working hours.
What we check


Known administrative accounts



Typical logon sources and times



Expected PowerShell usage patterns

How we validate / dismiss


Logons originated from unfamiliar sources



PowerShell commands were encoded and obfuscated



Activity did not align with documented administrative procedures

Conclusion: ❌ Likely ruled out

🔹 Hypothesis 2 – Misconfiguration or Automated System Activity
The activity may have been generated by an automated process, scheduled task, or system
misconfiguration.
What we check


Scheduled tasks



Service or system accounts



Non-interactive authentication events

How we validate / dismiss


PowerShell execution was interactive



Commands reflected manual reconnaissance behavior



No legitimate scheduled tasks were initially associated with the activity

Conclusion: ❌ ruled out

🔹 Hypothesis 3 – Unauthorized Credential-Based Access
An external actor may have attempted to gain access to the server using credential-based
techniques (such as brute-force attempts or Kerberos authentication weaknesses). Following
successful authentication, the attacker may have executed reconnaissance commands,
established persistence, and initiated staged data exfiltration.
What we check


Unusual authentication behavior



Interactive logons



PowerShell reconnaissance and obfuscation



Persistence mechanisms



Outbound data transfer patterns

Supporting Evidence


Kerberos authentication events without pre-authentication (4768 – PreAuthType = 0),
consistent with AS-REP roasting attempts



Successful interactive logons on the Domain Controller (4624)



Encoded PowerShell execution shortly after authentication (4104)



Reconnaissance commands to enumerate user privileges and locate backup files



Creation of a scheduled task configured to execute every five minutes



Repeated outbound connections transferring small portions of data to an external
server

Analysis
The observed activity follows a logical attack progression: credential access attempts,
successful interactive authentication, post-authentication reconnaissance, persistence via
scheduled tasks, and staged data exfiltration. The use of encoded PowerShell commands and
living-off-the-land techniques suggests deliberate efforts to evade detection.
Conclusion: ✅ Most likely hypothesis supported

🔹 Hypothesis 4 – Malware or Automated Exploit
The server may have been compromised by malware or an automated exploit without direct
human interaction.
What we check


Unknown or suspicious binaries



Exploit artifacts



Indicators of automated malware execution

How we validate / dismiss


No malicious binaries were identified



Activity relied primarily on native system tools



Execution patterns suggest hands-on-keyboard interaction

Conclusion: ⚠️ Unlikely

Summary
Based on the correlation of multiple indicators, including Kerberos ticket anomalies, interactive
logons, encoded PowerShell execution, and system reconnaissance commands, hypotheses
involving legitimate administrative activity or automated processes were eliminated. The
evidence strongly supports unauthorized credential-based access as the most plausible
explanation for the observed behavior.
